# Nitrogen (N)
- Essential for protein development which yields higher nutrition
- Nitrogen is an essential element of all the amino acids in plant structures which are the building blocks of plant proteins, important in the growth and development of vital plant tissues and cells like the cell membranes and chlorophyll.
- Foliage development
- Photosynthesis

# Phosphorous (P)
- Lifecycle: seedlings, young plants
- Lifecycle: Post young plant, P is redirected for use in seed formation
- Lifecycle: harvest - the plant will have taken up 10-30% in the first year, leaving the slow-moving P for next year
- Is a constituent of plant cells, essential for cell division and development of the growing tip of the plant
- Helps in flowering
- In ground: P moves very little in the soil and will not leach or brought down to the roots via osmosis
  - Will also want to bind with other soil minerals
- Linked to ability to use and store energy
- Can have uptake increased by adding lime to raise pH to 5

# Potassium (K)
- Partially mobile, apply close to time of planting
- Plays a large role in physiological processes and required in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction
- Increases root growth
- Raises disease resistance
- Strengthens root system
- Plants take up large quantities during lifecycle
- Associated with the movement of water and enzyme activation, including ATP
- Aids in food formation

Carrots
- little N, more PK: 0-10-10, 5-15-15, can also use bonemeal
- Fertilize when reached 3" tall
- Too much fertilizer spoils the taste
  - Note when/what fertilizer was done
- Carrots are high in K, use potash side dressed 4-8 weeks after planting

Beets
- Similar to carrots
- Index on P
- Heavy feeders

Kale
- Balanced 5-4-5 or 8-4-8
- Heavy feeder
- Start fertilizing after second set of true leaves
- Fertilize every 2 weeks

Broccoli
- Heaver feeder
- For large heads, need more P, K
- Fertilize when plants reach 6", then every 2 weeks after harvesting until new buds form

Bell peppers

Spinach
- 20-15-60 as percentages
- About every 4 weeks
